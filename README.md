# Tech_Test
A Tech Quiz application enhanced by Cypress for both component and end-to-end tests.

The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It allows users to take a quiz of ten random questions and view their final score.

This app has been enhanced by added Cypress tests for both component and end-to-end tests.


## Testing Functionality

# The end-to end test suite covers the essential functionality of a quiz application including:

 - uses beforeEach to start the localhost before each test
 - Question navigation
 - Answer selection and submission
 - Progress tracking
 - Final score display
 - Retake quiz

# The component test suite includes:

 - Uses beforeEach to mount the component before each test
 - Tests basic component rendering
 - Verifies question display
 - Tests answer selection functionality
 - Verifies submit button presence and functionality
 - Tests form submission and feedback
